# Qiskit Qward Project Overview

Qiskit Qward is a framework for analyzing and validating quantum algorithm execution quality on quantum processing units (QPUs). It provides a structured approach for building quantum validators that can be used to assess how well quantum circuits perform on real hardware.

## Key Components

The framework consists of several key components:

1. **Scanning Quantum Circuit System**: 
   - Extends Qiskit's QuantumCircuit to provide validation and scanning capabilities
   - Handles circuit creation, simulation, and execution on IBM Quantum hardware
   - Provides a standardized interface for implementing quantum validators

2. **Analysis Framework**:
   - Processes execution results to extract meaningful insights
   - Includes success rate analysis to evaluate algorithm performance
   - Supports visualization of results for better understanding

3. **Example Implementations**:
   - **Flip Coin Validator**: A simple quantum coin flip example showcasing basic superposition
   - **Two Doors Enigma Validator**: A more complex validator implementing the quantum solution to the "two doors enigma" puzzle
