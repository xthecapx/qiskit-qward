# Qiskit Qward Project Overview

Qiskit Qward is a Python library designed to assist in the analysis of quantum circuits and their execution quality, particularly when targeting quantum processing units (QPUs) or simulators. It offers a structured way to apply various metric strategies to quantum circuits and their results.

## Key Components

The library revolves around the following key components:

1.  **`Scanner` (`qward.Scanner`)**: 
    -   The main orchestrator for analysis.
    -   Takes a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` and optionally execution `Job` or `Result` objects.
    -   Users add various metric strategy objects to the `Scanner` to perform specific analyses.

2.  **Metric Strategy System (`qward.metrics`)**:
    -   A collection of classes for performing specific analyses. Each metric strategy class typically focuses on a particular aspect of the circuit or its execution results.
    -   Key built-in strategies include:
        -   `QiskitMetrics`: For basic circuit properties (depth, width, gate counts).
        -   `ComplexityMetrics`: For advanced circuit complexity analysis (based on D. Shami's work) and Quantum Volume estimation.
        -   `SuccessRate`: For calculating success/error rates from execution counts against user-defined criteria.
    -   Extensible: Users can create custom metric strategies by inheriting from `qward.metrics.base_metric.MetricCalculator`.

3.  **`Result` (`qward.Result`)**:
    -   A helper class to encapsulate Qiskit job execution results, particularly counts and metadata, for use with the `Scanner` and certain metric strategies.




4.  **Example Implementations (`qward/examples/`)**:
    -   The `qward/examples/` directory contains scripts and notebooks (e.g., `aer.py`, `run_on_aer.ipynb`) demonstrating how to use the `Scanner` with various metric strategies and Qiskit's Aer simulator.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Qiskit Qward project are to:

1.  Provide a flexible toolkit for evaluating quantum circuit properties and execution performance.
2.  Enable comparison between simulated and real hardware execution through consistent metric application.
3.  Support quantum algorithm analysis through a standardized and extensible metric strategy framework.
4.  Offer robust circuit complexity and Quantum Volume estimation capabilities.

## Background

Qward aims to simplify the process of analyzing quantum circuits and understanding their behavior. As quantum computing continues to evolve, developers and researchers need tools to assess how their quantum algorithms perform, both in simulation and on actual hardware.

## Solution Explanation

Qward helps bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and their practical implementation by providing:

-   A `Scanner` to orchestrate the application of various analytical metric strategy objects.
-   Comprehensive strategies for circuit structure (`QiskitMetrics`), advanced complexity and QV estimation (`ComplexityMetrics`), and execution outcome analysis (`SuccessRate`).
-   An extensible system for users to define their own custom metric strategies.
-   Utilities like `Result` for easier data handling.

This framework enables researchers and developers to gain deeper insights into their circuits, identify performance characteristics, understand error sources when results are available, and potentially optimize their quantum algorithms.

## Current Implementation Status

The project is under active development. Key implemented features include:

### Implemented Features
-   Core `Scanner` class for strategy-based analysis.
-   `Result` class for handling execution data.

-   Metric Strategy System:
    -   `QiskitMetrics` for circuit basics.
    -   `ComplexityMetrics` including detailed complexity categories and Quantum Volume estimation.
    -   `SuccessRate` strategy for execution outcome analysis.
    -   Abstract `MetricCalculator` base class for custom strategy development.
-   Integration with Qiskit's `QuantumCircuit`, `Job`, and `Result` objects.
