# QWARD Project Overview

## Introduction

QWARD (Quantum Workflow Analysis and Runtime Development) is a comprehensive Python library designed for analyzing quantum circuits and their execution performance on quantum processing units (QPUs) and simulators. Built on top of Qiskit, QWARD provides a unified framework for extracting, calculating, and visualizing quantum circuit metrics with schema-based validation for enhanced data integrity and type safety.

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between calculation, validation, and visualization
- **Scanner Orchestration**: Unified interface for managing multiple analysis strategies

## Core Components

### Scanner
The central orchestrator that manages quantum circuit analysis workflows. It coordinates multiple metric calculators and returns consolidated results as pandas DataFrames while automatically handling schema-to-DataFrame conversion.

### Metric Calculators
Specialized classes for different types of quantum circuit analysis:

#### QiskitMetrics
Extracts fundamental circuit properties directly from QuantumCircuit objects:
- **Basic Metrics**: Depth, width, gate counts, qubit/classical bit counts
- **Instruction Metrics**: Multi-qubit gate analysis, connectivity factors
- **Scheduling Metrics**: Timing and resource utilization information
- **Returns**: `QiskitMetricsSchema` with validated data and type safety

#### ComplexityMetrics
Calculates comprehensive circuit complexity based on research literature:
- **Gate-based Analysis**: T-count, CNOT count, multi-qubit ratios
- **Entanglement Metrics**: Entangling gate density and width analysis
- **Standardized Measures**: Circuit volume, gate density, Clifford ratios
- **Advanced Indicators**: Parallelism efficiency and circuit optimization metrics
- **Quantum Volume Estimation**: Both standard and enhanced QV calculations
- **Returns**: `ComplexityMetricsSchema` with comprehensive validation

#### CircuitPerformanceMetrics
Analyzes execution results and performance characteristics:
- **Success Analysis**: Customizable success criteria and error rate calculation
- **Fidelity Metrics**: Theoretical and experimental fidelity comparisons
- **Statistical Analysis**: Shot distribution, entropy, and uniformity measures
- **Multi-job Support**: Aggregate analysis across multiple execution runs
- **Returns**: `CircuitPerformanceSchema` with cross-field validation

### Schema Validation System
Comprehensive data validation using Pydantic schemas:
- **Automatic Type Checking**: Ensures data integrity at calculation time
- **Constraint Validation**: Range checks and business rule enforcement
- **Cross-field Validation**: Consistency checks between related metrics
- **JSON Schema Generation**: Automatic API documentation creation
- **Error Prevention**: Early detection of data inconsistencies

## Unified API Design

QWARD provides a clean, consistent API across all metric calculators:

```python
# All metric classes follow the same pattern
metrics = calculator.get_metrics()  # Returns validated schema object
value = metrics.category.specific_metric  # Type-safe access with IDE support

# Scanner automatically handles DataFrame conversion
scanner = Scanner(circuit=circuit)
scanner.add_strategy(QiskitMetrics(circuit))
dataframes = scanner.calculate_metrics()  # Returns DataFrames for analysis
```

### Benefits of the Unified Approach
1. **Consistency**: All metric classes have identical interfaces
2. **Type Safety**: Validated data with full IDE autocomplete support
3. **Error Prevention**: Schema validation catches issues early
4. **Flexibility**: Easy conversion between schema objects and DataFrames
5. **Documentation**: Automatic API documentation generation

## Research Foundation

QWARD's complexity metrics are based on established quantum computing research, particularly:

- **"Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis"** by D. Shami
- **Quantum Volume methodology** from IBM Research
- **Circuit optimization principles** from quantum algorithm design literature

The library implements these research findings in a practical, extensible framework suitable for both academic research and industrial applications.
