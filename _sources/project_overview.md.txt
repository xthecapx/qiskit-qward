# Project Overview

## Introduction

QWARD (Quantum Workflow Analysis and Runtime Diagnostics) is a Python library designed to provide comprehensive analysis of quantum circuits and their execution characteristics. Built on top of Qiskit, QWARD offers a systematic approach to understanding quantum algorithm performance through various metrics and visualization tools.

## Core Features

### Metric Calculation System
QWARD provides three main categories of metrics:

-   `QiskitMetrics`: Basic circuit properties extracted directly from QuantumCircuit objects
-   `ComplexityMetrics`: Advanced complexity analysis based on research literature
-   `CircuitPerformanceMetrics`: For calculating success/error rates from execution counts against user-defined criteria.

### Schema-Based Validation
- **Type Safety**: Automatic validation using Pydantic schemas
- **Cross-field Validation**: Ensures data consistency (e.g., error_rate = 1 - success_rate)
- **IDE Support**: Full autocomplete and type hints
- **API Documentation**: Automatic JSON schema generation

### Visualization System
- Comprehensive plotting capabilities for metric analysis
- Dashboard creation for multi-metric visualization
- Customizable plot configurations and styling
- Integration with popular plotting libraries

## Architecture

QWARD follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Scanner (Context)
The central orchestrator that manages metric calculators and coordinates their execution. It provides a unified interface for adding metrics and calculating results.

### Metric Calculators (Strategies)
Individual calculators that implement specific analysis algorithms:
- Each calculator focuses on a specific aspect of circuit analysis
- Calculators can be combined for comprehensive analysis
- Support for both traditional dictionary and modern schema outputs

### Result Management
Structured handling of quantum circuit execution results with support for:
- Multiple job analysis
- Metadata preservation
- Serialization and persistence

## Key Benefits

### Comprehensive Analysis
QWARD enables analysis of quantum circuits from multiple perspectives:
- **Static Analysis**: Circuit structure, complexity, and theoretical properties
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution performance, success rates, and fidelity metrics (`CircuitPerformanceMetrics`)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance across different backends, noise models, or algorithm variants

### Extensibility
The library is designed for easy extension:
- Custom metric calculators can be added by implementing the base interface
- New visualization types can be integrated into the existing framework
- Schema validation can be extended for custom metrics

### Integration
QWARD integrates seamlessly with the Qiskit ecosystem:
- Works with any QuantumCircuit object
- Supports results from simulators and real quantum hardware
- Compatible with Qiskit Runtime and other execution frameworks

## Use Cases

### Algorithm Development
- Analyze circuit complexity during algorithm design
- Compare different implementations of quantum algorithms
- Optimize circuits based on complexity metrics

### Performance Evaluation
- Assess algorithm performance on different backends
- Analyze the impact of noise on circuit execution
- Track performance improvements over time

### Research and Education
- Generate comprehensive reports for research publications
- Create visualizations for educational materials
- Benchmark quantum algorithms systematically

## Getting Started

QWARD is designed to be intuitive for both beginners and advanced users:

1. **Quick Start**: Simple examples get you running in minutes
2. **Comprehensive Guides**: Detailed documentation for advanced features
3. **Example Gallery**: Real-world examples demonstrating best practices

The library supports both traditional dictionary-based outputs for backward compatibility and modern schema-based validation for enhanced type safety and data integrity.

## Future Roadmap

QWARD continues to evolve with the quantum computing landscape:
- Additional metric calculators based on emerging research
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Integration with new Qiskit features and backends
- Performance optimizations for large-scale analysis

For detailed usage instructions, see the [Beginner's Guide](beginners_guide.md) and [Technical Documentation](technical_docs.md).

## Key Components

The library revolves around the following key components:

1.  **`Scanner` (`qward.Scanner`)**: 
    -   The main orchestrator for analysis.
    -   Takes a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` and optionally execution `Job` or `Result` objects.
    -   Users add various metric strategy objects to the `Scanner` to perform specific analyses.

2.  **Metric Strategy System (`qward.metrics`)**:
    -   A collection of classes for performing specific analyses. Each metric strategy class typically focuses on a particular aspect of the circuit or its execution results.
    -   Key built-in strategies include:
        -   `QiskitMetrics`: For basic circuit properties (depth, width, gate counts).
        -   `ComplexityMetrics`: For advanced circuit complexity analysis (based on D. Shami's work) and Quantum Volume estimation.
        -   `CircuitPerformanceMetrics`: For calculating success/error rates from execution counts against user-defined criteria.
    -   Extensible: Users can create custom metric strategies by inheriting from `qward.metrics.base_metric.MetricCalculator`.

3.  **`Result` (`qward.Result`)**:
    -   A helper class to encapsulate Qiskit job execution results, particularly counts and metadata, for use with the `Scanner` and certain metric strategies.

4.  **Example Implementations (`qward/examples/`)**:
    -   The `qward/examples/` directory contains scripts and notebooks (e.g., `aer.py`, `run_on_aer.ipynb`) demonstrating how to use the `Scanner` with various metric strategies and Qiskit's Aer simulator.

## Documentation Structure

-   **Beginner's Guide**: Introduction to Qward concepts and basic examples.
-   **Quickstart Guide**: Installation and core usage patterns.
-   **Technical Documentation**: More detailed component descriptions (see `docs/architecture.md`).
-   **API Documentation**: Full API reference (see `docs/apidocs/index.rst`).
-   **Examples**: Practical code examples in the `qward/examples/` directory.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Qiskit Qward project are to:

1.  Provide a flexible toolkit for evaluating quantum circuit properties and execution performance.
2.  Enable comparison between simulated and real hardware execution through consistent metric application.
3.  Support quantum algorithm analysis through a standardized and extensible metric strategy framework.
4.  Offer robust circuit complexity and Quantum Volume estimation capabilities.

## Background

Qward aims to simplify the process of analyzing quantum circuits and understanding their behavior. As quantum computing continues to evolve, developers and researchers need tools to assess how their quantum algorithms perform, both in simulation and on actual hardware.

## Solution Explanation

Qward helps bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and their practical implementation by providing:

-   A `Scanner` to orchestrate the application of various analytical metric strategy objects.
-   Comprehensive strategies for circuit structure (`QiskitMetrics`), advanced complexity and QV estimation (`ComplexityMetrics`), and execution outcome analysis (`CircuitPerformanceMetrics`).
-   An extensible system for users to define their own custom metric strategies.
-   Utilities like `Result` for easier data handling.

This framework enables researchers and developers to gain deeper insights into their circuits, identify performance characteristics, understand error sources when results are available, and potentially optimize their quantum algorithms.
