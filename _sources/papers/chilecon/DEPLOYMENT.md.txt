# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

This document explains the GitHub Pages deployment setup for the qWard ChileCon presentation.

## 📋 What Was Set Up

### 1. Build Scripts (`package.json`)

Added the following npm scripts:
- `npm run clean` - Removes the dist folder
- `npm run build` - Builds the presentation for deployment
- `npm run copy:files` - Copies HTML, CSS, JS, and images to dist/
- `npm run copy:reveal` - Copies reveal.js dependencies to dist/

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`)

Created an automated deployment pipeline that:
- Triggers on push to `main` branch (when changes are in `docs/papers/chilecon/`)
- Can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Installs dependencies with npm
- Builds the presentation
- Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### 3. Git Ignore (`docs/papers/chilecon/.gitignore`)

Updated to exclude:
- `dist/` - Build output folder
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (never commit these)
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files

**Note**: `package-lock.json` is **committed** to the repository to ensure reproducible builds in CI/CD

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### First Time Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings**:
   - Go to: `Settings` → `Pages`
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Save changes

2. **Verify Build Locally** (Optional):
   ```bash
   cd docs/papers/chilecon
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Check that dist/ folder is created with all files
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment for ChileCon presentation"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Go to: `Actions` tab in GitHub
   - Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Once complete (green checkmark), your site is live!

### Future Deployments

Every time you push changes to files in `docs/papers/chilecon/`, the site will automatically rebuild and redeploy.

**Manual Trigger** (if needed):
1. Go to: `Actions` tab
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

## 🌐 Accessing Your Presentation

Once deployed, your presentation will be available at:

```
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

For example:
- Repository: `xthecapx/qiskit-qward`
- URL: `https://xthecapx.github.io/qiskit-qward/`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails in GitHub Actions

**Check the logs**:
1. Go to `Actions` tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Expand the failed step to see error details

**Common issues**:
- **Cache dependency error**: Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed to the repository
  ```
  Error: Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies.
  ```
  Solution: Remove `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` and commit it
- **Missing dependencies**: Verify `package-lock.json` exists in the repository
- **Build script errors**: Test locally with `npm run build`
- **Path issues**: Verify file paths are correct in workflow

### Site Not Updating

1. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Check deployment**: Verify the workflow completed successfully in Actions
3. **Wait a moment**: GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to propagate changes

### 404 Error

1. **Verify GitHub Pages is enabled**: Check repository Settings → Pages
2. **Check source**: Ensure it's set to "GitHub Actions"
3. **Verify workflow ran**: Check Actions tab for successful deployment

## 📁 Build Output Structure

After running `npm run build`, the `dist/` folder contains:

```
dist/
├── index.html                    # Main presentation file
├── *.css                         # All stylesheets
├── *.js                          # JavaScript files
├── *.png                         # All images
└── node_modules/
    └── reveal.js/
        ├── dist/                 # reveal.js core
        └── plugin/               # reveal.js plugins
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Deployment Branch

Edit `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change this to your preferred branch
```

### Deploying from Different Directory

Edit the `working-directory` in `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: docs/papers/chilecon  # Change this path
```

### Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to `docs/papers/chilecon/`:
   ```
   your-domain.com
   ```

2. Update build script in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "copy:files": "cp index.html CNAME dist/ && cp *.css dist/ ..."
   ```

3. Configure DNS records as per [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test locally before pushing**: Always run `npm run build` and check the output
2. **Use workflow_dispatch**: Enable manual triggers for controlled deployments
3. **Monitor Actions**: Watch the first few deployments to ensure everything works
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update reveal.js and other packages
